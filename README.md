This was a template for [Typesafe Activator](http://typesafe.com/platform/getstarted).
However, Typesafe Activator was taken offline in 2017.
Therefore, this template is being brought up to date as of Slick 3.2.3 as a learning exercise.

If you somehow stumbled across this repo, I hope you find it useful!
All goodness credit to Lightbend, faults are my own.

Once a connection is established with the DB,
run HelloSlickDatabaseInit tables and data will be added for you.
